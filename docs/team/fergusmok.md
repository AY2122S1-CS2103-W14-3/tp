## **EdRecord**
EdRecord is a **desktop app for managing student contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a TA that can type fast, EdRecord can get your student contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
